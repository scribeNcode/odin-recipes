      <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
      <li>12 ounces brown gravy</li>
      <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

      <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry ziti pasta</li>

    <h2>How to Make Baked Pasta</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
        baking dish with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large frying pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and
        stir ground beef in the hot pan until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
        minutes. Add tomato sauce, gravy, half-and-half, Parmesan cheese,
        garlic, oregano, and basil. Simmer for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
        rolling boil. Stir in ziti, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over
        medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir ziti into meat sauce, then spread into the prepared baking dish.
        Sprinkle top with mozzarella cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
