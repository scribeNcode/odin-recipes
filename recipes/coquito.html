    <h2>What Is Coquito?</h2>
    <p>
      Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico. In
      Spanish, coquito means "little coconut." The beverage is coconut-based and
      spiked with rum. Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with
      egg yolks, is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as
      "Puerto Rican eggnog."
